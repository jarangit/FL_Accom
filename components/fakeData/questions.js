    question: `
    What Is The Lifestyle Like in Bangkok, Thailand ?
  `,
    answer: `Bangkok, Thailand is more than just temples and street food though; it's also home to nightclubs, bars and restaurants that cater to every taste. Even with all those attractions - you can find some peace by catching Bangkok's many riverside boat tours or strolling through one of Bangkok’s various local markets.
    When it comes to shopping, Bangkok does not disappoint there either. Just go to Phrom Phong or Siam, and enjoy the city’s malls where you’ll find a lot of popular and local brands to choose from. As for food, Thai food in Thailand just hits different. Especially the street food. Just imagine yourself living in Bangkok, perhaps a condo, apartment, or even a house, and then going out in the evening to enjoy delicious street food. You may find them in markets, or maybe just on the side of the road. Either way, it’s an experience unique to Thailand. However, there are also a vast variety of food choices apart from Thai food. There are also a lot of Western, and other Asian cuisines you can please your taste buds with.
